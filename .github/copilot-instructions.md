## Cortex Knowledge Base

This org uses a shared AI knowledge base called Cortex. It contains documentation for every registered service, org-wide coding conventions, infrastructure guides, and deployment patterns. **Before answering questions about how the org works, or before writing new code, use the Cortex MCP tools.**

**MCP Server:** `https://cortex-relay-dev-api.trinary.exchange/mcp`

## MCP Tools Available

### `search_context`

Use this to understand any service, domain, or system in the org.
- "How does the auth service work?" → `search_context({ query: "auth service" })`
- "What events does signer-api publish?" → `search_context({ query: "signer-api events" })`
- "Which service owns the ledger?" → `search_context({ query: "ledger ownership" })`

### `getConventions`

Use this before writing any new code. Always fetch conventions for the framework/language in use.
- NestJS service → `getConventions({ framework: "nestjs" })`
- TypeScript file → `getConventions({ language: "typescript" })`
- General org rules → `getConventions({ scope: "general" })`

### `chronicle_changes`

Use this before every commit. It generates the changelog entry and patches `overview.md` if needed. Always include the updated `.cortex/` files in the commit.
- `chronicle_changes({ service_id: "<from .cortex/manifest.yaml>", change_summary: "...", changed_files: [...] })`

## Priority Order for Context

1. **Cortex MCP tools** — always the first source for org knowledge and conventions
2. **`.cortex/overview.md`** — this repo's own description of what it does
3. **Source files** — only after the above don't answer the question

## Org Conventions Summary

- All services use structured JSON logging via Pino — never `console.log`
- Secrets come from environment variables only — never hardcoded
- Trunk-based development: short-lived branches, PR to `main`
- All NestJS services follow the module/service/controller pattern in `src/`
- Drizzle ORM for database access — no raw SQL queries outside migrations
